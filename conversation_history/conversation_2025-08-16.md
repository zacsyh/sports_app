## Initial Query
User asked for help creating a fitness activity monitoring app with the following features:
- Custom fitness project creation (two modes):
  - Mode 1: Sets × reps (e.g., "Push-ups 4 sets × 15 reps")
  - Mode 2: Total count/weight (e.g., "Squats 200 times" or "Dumbbell curls 10kg")
- Real-time tracking and status updates
- Multi-dimensional popup reminders:
  - Overall project reminders (daily fixed time)
  - Individual project reminders (per item deadline)
- Growth records and achievement motivation
- Multi-project management
- Android system design
- Local data storage only (no server storage)

## Project Brief Creation
Created project brief document at `docs/project-brief.md` using the Business Analyst agent.

## Follow-up Discussion
